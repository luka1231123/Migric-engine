/// @file GameObject.hpp
/// @brief Defines the base class for all game objects that can be
/// updated and drawn.

// The GameObject class serves as a simple interface for objects in
// the engine.  Each game object must implement an `update()` method
// which is invoked every frame to perform logic and state changes.
// Because GameObject derives from sf::Drawable, derived classes must
// also override the protected `draw()` method to render themselves to
// an `sf::RenderTarget`.

    /// per frame by the object manager.  Derived classes should
    /// override this to implement gameâ€‘specific behaviour.
